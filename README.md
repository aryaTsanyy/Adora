## About This Project

**Adora** is a modern ecommerce landing page website built as a collaborative project during my internship at Potara Studio.  
This landing page was developed together with my partners **Desmonda Varel** and **Shabina** at Potara Studio, where I contributed as a Front-end Developer.  
Our goal was to create a visually appealing, and interactive shopping experience using the latest web technologies.

One of the unique features of this project is a **mini game** where users can play a matching outfit game—allowing you to mix and match different clothing items to create your own style.

The project showcases advanced UI/UX, custom animated cursors, smooth scrolling, and a mini game where u can dress up your outfit. layout powered by Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
